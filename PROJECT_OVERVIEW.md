# GSE Sentiment Analysis Project - Simple Guide

## 🤔 What is This Project About?

Imagine you're an investor in Ghana's stock market (called the GSE - Ghana Stock Exchange). You want to know if people are feeling positive or negative about companies like MTN, GCB Bank, or AngloGold Ashanti. This project helps you understand what regular people, news outlets, and social media are saying about these companies, and uses that information to predict whether stock prices might go up or down.

**In simple terms:** We're listening to what everyone is saying about Ghanaian companies online, and using that "conversation" to help investors make smarter decisions.

## 🎯 Why Does This Matter?

### The Problem
Traditional stock market analysis only looks at numbers - price charts, company profits, economic data. But what about human feelings? What about news headlines, social media buzz, or public opinion? These things can drive stock prices up or down, sometimes even more than the numbers!

### The Solution
This project combines:
- **What people are saying** (sentiment analysis)
- **Smart computer programs** (artificial intelligence)
- **Real-time monitoring** (always up-to-date)

## 🏗️ What I Built

### 1. **Smart Listening System**
- **Reads news articles** from 6 Ghanaian websites (GhanaWeb, MyJoyOnline, etc.)
- **Monitors social media** (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit)
- **Collects expert opinions** through a manual input system
- **Processes everything automatically** 24/7

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis Brain**
- **Understands emotions** in text (positive, negative, or neutral)
- **Speaks multiple languages** (English, Twi, Ga)
- **Learns from context** (understands financial terms)
- **Gets smarter over time** with more data

### 3. **Prediction Engine**
- **12 different AI models** working together
- **Predicts stock movements** (will price go up or down?)
- **Shows confidence levels** (how sure is the prediction?)
- **Learns from past performance** to improve accuracy

### 4. **Interactive Dashboard**
- **Live visualizations** of market sentiment
- **Easy-to-understand charts** and graphs
- **Real-time updates** as new data comes in
- **Export capabilities** for research and reports
