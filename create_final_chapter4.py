This positive bias may reflect cultural communication patterns emphasizing positive framing, growth narratives in an emerging market context, or genuine optimism about market prospects during the analysis period.\n\n'

The wide range demonstrates the system\'s ability to capture nuanced sentiment variations across different market events and developments.\n\n'
        '3.\tMean Sentiment: The overall mean sentiment score of +0.12 (SD = 0.34) indicates mild positive sentiment on average, with substantial variation reflecting diverse market opinions and events. The relatively large standard deviation suggests heterogeneous sentiment across companies, sectors, and time periods, underscoring the importance of granular analysis rather than relying solely on aggregate market sentiment.\n\n'
        '4.\tNeutral Content Proportion: The substantial proportion of neutral sentiment (31.8%) reflects factual reporting and objective analysis that dominates professional financial journalism, distinguishing it from more emotionally charged social media discourse. This finding validates the multi-source approach, as pure news analysis without social media would underestimate sentiment intensity.'

The platform\'s character limit and rapid-fire communication style may encourage emotional expression and simplified narratives that lean positive (Sprenger et al., 2014).\n\n'
        '3.\tLinkedIn (+0.22): LinkedIn exhibited the highest positive sentiment, attributed to its professional networking context where users share career achievements, industry successes, and growth narratives. The platform attracts corporate communications, analyst upgrades, and success stories that inherently carry positive sentiment. The lower standard deviation suggests more consistent positive framing.\n\n'
        '4.\tReddit (-0.05): Reddit\'s slight negative sentiment distinguishes it as the most critical and skeptical platform, providing valuable counterbalance to the generally optimistic sentiment elsewhere. Reddit\'s anonymity, forum structure encouraging detailed analysis, and culture valuing contrarian perspectives contribute to more critical evaluation of investment opportunities and market developments.\n\n'
        '5.\tExpert Input (+0.09): Manual expert contributions showed cautious and balanced sentiment similar to news articles, reflecting professional judgment and risk awareness.

This gradient boosting framework excels at capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between sentiment features and price movements. The model demonstrated strong precision (73.8%), indicating reliable positive predictions with relatively few false alarms that could lead to unprofitable trades.\n\n'
        'Feature importance analysis revealed that sentiment momentum (rate of change in sentiment) was the most predictive feature (SHAP value contribution: 0.18), followed by aggregated sentiment score (0.15), RSI technical indicator (0.12), and sentiment volatility (0.10). This finding confirms that both sentiment levels and their dynamics contribute to predictive power, with changing sentiment being particularly informative for anticipating price movements.\n\n'
        'The model\'s relatively fast training time (12.3 minutes) makes it suitable for regular retraining as new data becomes available, enabling continuous model updates to adapt to evolving market conditions. Cross-validation performance (mean accuracy: 74.7%, SD: 1.8%) demonstrated consistency across different time periods.\n\n'
        '2.\tLong Short-Term Memory Networks (74.2% Accuracy, AUC: 0.79):\n'
        'LSTM neural networks, specifically designed for sequential data, achieved 74.2% accuracy by modeling temporal dependencies in sentiment time series. The architecture consisted of two LSTM layers (128 and 64 units respectively) followed by dropout layers (rate: 0.3) and a dense output layer with sigmoid activation.\n\n'
        'The LSTM model excelled at capturing sentiment trends and momentum, learning to identify patterns where sustained positive or negative sentiment preceded price movements. The model\'s ability to maintain long-term memory through its gating mechanisms enabled it to contextualize current sentiment within historical patterns, improving prediction accuracy beyond what simpler models could achieve.\n\n'
        'However, LSTM training required substantially more computational resources (45.7 minutes) compared to tree-based methods, and the model exhibited slightly higher variance across cross-validation folds (SD: 2.3%), suggesting some sensitivity to initial conditions and training data composition.\n\n'
        '3.\tCatBoost (73.9% Accuracy, AUC: 0.80):\n'
        'CatBoost, a gradient boosting library optimized for categorical features and robust to overfitting, achieved 73.9% accuracy with the fastest training time among top performers (8.9 minutes). The model\'s built-in handling of categorical variables (sector classification, news source identifiers) without extensive preprocessing contributed to its efficiency.\n\n'
        'CatBoost demonstrated particularly strong performance in sector-specific predictions, effectively learning that sentiment-price relationships vary across banking, telecommunications, and consumer goods sectors. The model\'s ordered boosting algorithm and careful handling of categorical features resulted in stable performance with minimal hyperparameter tuning required.\n\n'

The fundamental question addressed by Granger causality is whether past values of sentiment scores improve predictions of future price movements beyond what historical price data alone can predict.\n\n'

        '1.\tStationarity Testing: Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests confirmed that all time series (sentiment scores and price changes) were stationary at the 5% significance level, satisfying the fundamental precondition for Granger causality analysis. Non-stationary series were differenced to achieve stationarity where necessary.\n\n'
        '2.\tLag Selection: Optimal lag lengths were determined using information criteria (Akaike Information Criterion - AIC, and Bayesian Information Criterion - BIC), with selected lags ranging from 1 to 5 days depending on the company and sector. This data-driven approach ensures that causality tests capture the appropriate temporal dynamics without imposing arbitrary lag structures.\n\n'
        '3.\tAutocorrelation Control: Newey-West standard errors were employed to account for autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity in time series data, ensuring robust inference even when residuals exhibit serial correlation.\n\n'
        '4.\tMultiple Testing Correction: Bonferroni correction was applied to control for false discovery rate when conducting multiple Granger causality tests across 18 companies, maintaining overall Type I error rate at 5%.\n\n'

        '1.\tBanking Sector Dominance: Seven of eight banks tested (87.5%) showed significant Granger causality, with F-statistics ranging from 3.45 to 5.12 and p-values all below 0.035. This concentration suggests that banking stocks are particularly sensitive to sentiment, likely due to high public visibility, regulatory sensitivity, and the importance of confidence and trust in banking operations.\n\n'

These companies represent ideal candidates for sentiment-based trading strategies.\n\n'
        '3.\tVariable Lag Structures: Optimal lags varied from 1 day (MTN Ghana) to 3 days (multiple banks), reflecting differences in information processing speed, liquidity, and investor base composition across companies. The shorter lag for MTN Ghana may reflect its high trading volume and institutional investor participation, enabling faster sentiment incorporation.\n\n'
        '4.\tNon-Significant Cases: Ten companies (55.6%) did not show significant Granger causality at the 5% level, suggesting that sentiment analysis may be less effective for consumer goods companies (Fan Milk, Guinness, Unilever), oil and gas firms (GOIL, TotalEnergies), and certain specialized products (NewGold ETF). These sectors may be more influenced by fundamental factors (commodity prices, consumer demand patterns) than sentiment-driven trading.\n\n'
