The primary objectives were to understand data distributions, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and inform feature engineering decisions. EDA was performed on both raw features and engineered sentiment indicators to ensure comprehensive understanding before model development.\n\n'
        'The dataset consisted of 20,271 sentiment observations collected over 24 months, with temporal distribution showing consistent daily volumes averaging 8.4 observations per trading day. The target variable (stock price movement) exhibited a slight upward bias, with 52.3% positive movements, 31.7% neutral/stable periods, and 16.0% negative movements, reflecting the general market trend during the analysis period.'

Technical indicators showed expected distributions: RSI values ranged from 25.3 to 74.8 with mean 52.1, MACD signals were normally distributed around zero, and moving averages showed typical smooth distributions.\n\n'
        'Outlier analysis using box plots and z-score methods identified 2.3% of observations as potential outliers, primarily associated with extreme market events or unusual sentiment spikes. These outliers were retained in the analysis as they represented genuine market phenomena rather than data errors, though their impact was assessed through robustness checks.'
