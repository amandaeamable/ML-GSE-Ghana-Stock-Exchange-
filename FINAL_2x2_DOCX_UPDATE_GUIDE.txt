3. BETTER READABILITY: Addresses supervisor's concern about unclear axes
4. PROFESSIONAL FORMATTING: Academic-style with proper labels and statistics
5. REAL DATA: Uses actual GSE company names and sentiment scores
6. SINGLE FILE: Easier to insert into DOCX document

SUPERVISOR REQUIREMENTS ADDRESSED:
==================================

✓ "Make it 2x2 for him" → Two graphs per row layout implemented
✓ "Two graphs on one row instead of 4" → 2x2 grid (2 rows × 2 columns)
✓ "The figure is not clear to the eye, so find a way to enlarge them"
  → Larger individual plots with better formatting
✓ "Consider dividing the figure into two, each with two columns instead of the current four"
  → 2x2 layout addresses this exactly
✓ "It may mean using two columns instead of three" → 2x2 grid implemented
