### Step 4: Post-Processing
1. Crop to remove unnecessary UI elements
2. Ensure consistent sizing across all figures
3. Add figure numbers and captions in your thesis software
4. Maintain aspect ratios for professional appearance
5. Ensure all labels and values are clearly readable

### Step 5: Integration into Thesis
- Insert figures in Chapter 4 where the placeholders are located
- Ensure figure captions match the descriptions in the document
- Cross-reference figures in the text discussion
