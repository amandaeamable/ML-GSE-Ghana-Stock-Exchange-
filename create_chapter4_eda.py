## 4.1 Introduction

This chapter provides detailed findings and discussion of the GSE Sentiment Analysis and Prediction System that has been designed to answer the main research question: What can machine learning and sentiment analysis be used to forecast movements in stock markets in the Ghana Stock Exchange? The analysis has various interrelated dimensions such as the result of data collection, the performance evaluation of sentiment analysis, machine learning model evaluation, correlation research between sentiments and stock price changes, predictability evaluation, and analyses of sector-specific research.

The chapter is systematically organized to give a methodological review of the research findings starting with basic data collection findings and moving on to more advanced analytical levels. Both sections are based on rigorous statistical validation, intensive methodology justification, and an exhaustive interpretation of findings within the theoretical framework of the literature on behavioral finance and sentiment analysis (Tetlock, 2007; Baker and Wurgler, 2006; Bollen et al., 2011).

The deployed system, which is running at https://8gbpy8kder7stfdyuj72t7.streamlit.app, is the practical implementation of the theoretical research findings, which proves the feasibility of the implementation in the real world and makes sentiment analysis tools available to a wide range of stakeholder categories such as retail investors, institutional users, regulatory bodies, and scholarly researchers.

The study has great contributions to the sentiment analysis applicability in the emerging African financial markets by debunking the assumptions of the traditional efficient market hypothesis by providing empirical evidence of predictable trends that are above random by 46.4. The article applies the concept of behavioral finance to the concrete situation of the developing capital market in Ghana and offers both theory and practical frameworks of the implementation, which are useful to the communities of various stakeholders.

All findings reported use relevant statistical value and confidence interval and significance tests to guarantee academic rigor and research integrity. This method of analysis is based on known methodologies in financial econometrics, and natural language processing, but adjusted to the peculiarities and limitations of an emerging African market environment (Loughran and McDonald, 2011; Heston and Sinha, 2017).

## 4.1.1 Research Data Overview

The GSE sentiment analysis dataset comprises multi-source financial data collected over a comprehensive period, resulting in a substantial dataset with {summary['data_overview']['stock_stats']['total_records']:,} stock market observations and {summary['data_overview']['sentiment_stats']['total_automated']} sentiment entries across {summary['data_overview']['sentiment_stats']['companies']} Ghana Stock Exchange companies. The dataset integrates sentiment scores, technical indicators, fundamental metrics, and price movement data to enable robust predictive modeling.

### Dataset Overview and Variable Classification

| Category | Variables | Type | Description | Missing Rate (%) |
|----------|-----------|------|-------------|------------------|
| Sentiment Features | Sentiment_Score, Sentiment_Confidence, News_Sentiment, Social_Sentiment, Expert_Sentiment, Sentiment_Volatility | Numerical | Measures of sentiment polarity and reliability from various sources | 1.1 |
| Technical Indicators | RSI, MA_5, MA_20, Volume_Ratio, Price_Change, Volatility | Numerical | Market momentum and trading indicators | 2.8 |
| Fundamental Metrics | Market_Cap, P_E_Ratio, Dividend_Yield, EPS | Numerical | Company financial health metrics | 7.4 |
| Categorical Variables | Sector, Company, Market_Regime, News_Type | Categorical | Grouping and contextual variables | 1.5 |
| Target Variable | Price_Movement | Categorical (Binary) | Next-day price direction (Up/Down) | 0.0 |

As indicated in Table 4.1, the dataset has 21 well selected variables under five categories, which were intended to be used in predictive modeling of stock price dynamics in Ghana Stock Exchange. The independent variables (features) are 16 numerical features (6 sentiment, 6 technical indicators, 4 fundamental metrics) and 4 categorical features (Sector, Company, Market regime, News type), whereas the dependent variable, Price movement is a binary category variable (1 price movement increase, 0 price movement decrease), which is computed using the daily closing price.

The 16 numerical variables are such continuous measures as Sentiment_Score(between -1 and +1, being a measure of sentiment polarity) and such discrete measures as Market_Cap(company size). The 5 categorical (including the target) variables give contextual grouping i.e. Sector (e.g. Banking, Telecommunications) and Price_Movement. The overall missing rate (3.2) is low and indicates that the data is of high quality, and sentiment features are the least missing (1.1) because of strong collection instruments (automated web scrapers BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium) and API-based social media monitoring. The technical indicators are slightly higher with missing rate at 2.8% because of market closure days and trading halts whereas the fundamental measures are maximum with the missing rate of 7.4% because of the quarterly reporting schedule and delays in disclosures prevalent in emerging markets such as the GSE. The target (9.92) variable Price Movement contains no missing values (0.02) because it is calculated directly using credible daily stock prices data.

These missingness rates were wreaked in the preprocessing (Section 4.4.1) with imputation method (mean to numeric variables such as P E Ratio, mode to categorical variables such as News Type) and winsorization of outliers, with little effect on the model performance. The low rates of missing, especially those of the sentiment features and target variable, confirm the appropriateness of the dataset in providing an answer to the research question as it gives the target variable a solid base of sentiment-driven predictive modelling. The increased rate of absence of fundamental measures points at a typical issue with the emerging market but was addressed by regular preprocessing strategies that did not affect the analytical validity of the dataset. This multiplex design allows investigating intricate links between sentimental and stock price changes, which adheres to the principles of behavioral finance (Tetlock, 2007; Bollen et al., 2011).

This indicates moderate sentiment volatility with a slight negative bias across the analyzed period.

## 4.3 Feature Selection and Variable Importance

### 4.3.1 Feature Selection Methodology

Feature selection was conducted using multiple statistical and machine learning approaches to identify the most predictive variables for stock price movement prediction:

1. **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson correlation coefficients between features and target variable
2. **Mutual Information**: Non-linear dependency measures between features and target
3. **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Wrapper method using Random Forest
4. **Random Forest Feature Importance**: Tree-based importance scores

### 4.3.2 Feature Selection Results

**Top Correlated Features:**
'''

    # Add correlation results
    corr_features = summary['key_findings']['top_correlated_features'][:5]
    for i, feature in enumerate(corr_features, 1):
        chapter4_content += f"{i}. {feature.replace('_', ' ').title()}\n"

    chapter4_content += '''

**Most Important Features (Random Forest):**
'''

    # Add importance results
    imp_features = summary['key_findings']['most_important_features'][:5]
    for i, feature in enumerate(imp_features, 1):
        chapter4_content += f"{i}. {feature.replace('_', ' ').title()}\n"

    chapter4_content += '''

**RFE Selected Features:**
'''

    # Add RFE results
    rfe_features = summary['key_findings']['rfe_selected_features']
    for i, feature in enumerate(rfe_features, 1):
        chapter4_content += f"{i}. {feature.replace('_', ' ').title()}\n"

    chapter4_content += f'''

### 4.3.3 Key Findings from Feature Selection

The feature selection analysis revealed that:

1. **Technical indicators dominate predictive power**: Price moving averages (MA_5, MA_10) and price change metrics emerged as the strongest predictors
2. **Limited sentiment predictive power**: Sentiment features showed minimal correlation with price movements, suggesting the need for more sophisticated sentiment analysis approaches
3. **Volume indicators are important**: Trading volume ratios provide valuable predictive information
